# Grouvie
Grouvie is a simple group movie event planner app for Android devices. The aim of Grouvie is to make event planning much simler through a small series of steps. Grouvie also makes it easier to collect responses from plan suggestions and centralises all information in one place that a group chat cannot do. 

# Installation
You are able to install Grouvie on your Android phone through the following link.

# System Architecture
The front-end of Grouvie is written in Java using Android Studio using the deafult frameworks. We use a Flask web server written in Python for the back-end to interact with a ProgresSQL database. This webserver is hosted using Horuku as part of our Continuous Integration in place for this project.

# Disclaimer
Please note that Grouvie is as of yet an incomplete as a few obscure bugs stil persist that we are in the process of debugging. We also initially planned on adding a few features that are yet to be implemented such as the ability to book tickets within the app itself as well as having individual profile settings whereby users are suggested a film that may align to their movie preferences through previous plans made through Grouvie.

# Resources
As part of the implementation of Grouive, we use a few APIs to obtain Movie listings, movie synopsis and more. We also use the copyright free logo made by Dimi Kazak from [FlatIcon](http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/popcorn_230401)
